# DIO Challenge Abstracting a Bootcamp Using Object Orientation in Java

## PRESENTED IN THE PROJECT </a> ðŸ“œ </P>

<p> Welcome to the challenge: <strong>LEARNING THE OBJECT ORIENTATION PARADIGM IN PRACTICE.</strong><br>This challenge I had the honor of co-creating with the online course platform <strong><br> a href="https://web.digitalinnovation.one/">DIGITAL INNOVATION ONE</a></strong> ðŸ’›ðŸ§¡ and made available free of charge to the Java developer community.<br>
    ðŸ’Ž The main objective is to put into practice one of the main OO tools: <strong>ABSTRACTION, ENCAPSULATION, INHERITANCE AND POLYMORPHISM,</strong> through a Java project. </p>
## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
